# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: ___SQL Injection (SQLi)___

Vulnerability #2: ___Session Hijacking___

## Green

Vulnerability #1: ___Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)___

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work



## Concept Review
##### Which attacks were easiest to execute? Which were the most difficult?
  The easiest attacks to execute were IDOR, SQLi, Cross-Site Scripting and Session Hijacking/Fixation. Cross-Site Request Forgery and User Enumeration were the most difficult to execute. With CRSF, resubmitting the modified form was my biggest challenge. In specific, getting the form to automatically submit without user interaction.
  
##### What is a good rule of thumb which would prevent accidentally username enumeration vulnerabilities like the one created here?

##### Since you should be somewhat familiar with the CMS and how it was coded, can you think of another resource which could be made vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference? What code could be removed which would expose it? (Hint: It was also the answer to the first bonus objective to the Weekly Assignment for week 3.)
  

##### Many SQL Injections use OR as part of the injected code. (For example: ' OR 1=1 --'.) Could AND work just as well in place of OR? (For example: ' AND 1=1 --'.) Why or why not?
  No, AND is completely different and will not serve as a replacement to OR. The reason for this is because if AND is used, both the first user input and 1=1 need to be true for the injected code to work. On the other hand, OR is most effective because if the first input does not match any query results, 1=1 will always be true and all you need is one of those inputs to be true when using OR unlike AND where both user inputs need to be true.
##### A stored XSS attack requires patience because it could be stored for months before being triggered. Because of this, what important ingredient would an attacker most likely include in a stored XSS attack script?

##### Imagine that one of your classmates is an authorized admin for the site's CMS and you are not. How would you get them to visit the self-submitting, hidden form page you created in Objective #5 (CSRF)?

##### Compare session hijacking and session fixation. Which attack do you think is easier for an attacker to execute? Why? One of them is much easier to defend against than the other. Which one and why?
